# My Next Anime

This is a web application for anime fans to discover new animes, add them to favorites, comment on them and many such features. It is intended towards new anime fans who want to explore more about the vast anime world.

Over the time, I have grown fond of japanese anime shows and movies. But recently, I faced an issue of not being able to discover new anime in an easy way. So I have decided to create a web application specifically for this purpose.

The main aim of the application is to let users search for various animes, create a favorites list, like or unlike, give reviews and take part in discussions regarding the anime. The anime information will be obtained by Jikan mo API, which is an unofficial MAL API.

#### The features of this project are:

1. Create a profile and customize it

2. Search for anime with sorting and filtering options

3. View information about anime

4. Like or unlike

5. Give reviews and take part in discussions

6. Create a watchlist
